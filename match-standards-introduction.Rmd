# Introduction

Mixes of standards have been solved in water or added to human serum sample
pools in two different concentration and these samples were measured with the
LC-MS setup from Eurac (used also to generate the CHRIS untargeted metabolomics
data). Assignment of retention time and observed ion can be performed for each
standard based on MS1 information such as expected m/z but also based on the
expected difference in signal between samples with low and high concentration of
the standards. Finally, experimental fragment spectra provide the third level of
evidence. Thus, the present data set allows to annotate features to standards
based on 3 levels of evidence: expected m/z, difference in measured intensity
and MS2-based annotation.

The goal of this analysis is to create an in-house reference library for
our untargeted LC-MS setup. For that we:

- determine the retention time of each standard in water and serum.
- define which ions/adducts are measured for each standard (with relative
  abundances, i.e. which is most highly abundant ion etc).
- extract all MS2 spectra for each standard, match them against reference
  spectra and store them in a database.

The approach consists of the following steps:

- **Identification of potential features for a certain standard**. Features
  matching pre-defined adducts are identified. These are further sub-setted
  keeping only features which match the expected difference in intensities
  between *high* and *low* concentration samples. Resulting features are in
  addition grouped based in similar retention time (5 seconds) and similar
  abundance across samples (correlation > 0.6).
- **MS2 spectra of all selected features are matched against reference spectra
  for the standard from HMDB**. If no match is found and the ion is different
  than `[M+H]+` or `[M-H]-` a comparison between neutral loss spectra is
  performed in addition.
- **MS2 spectra of all selected features are matched against all HMDB and
  Massbank**. This is to evaluate specificity of the fragment spectra.

Based on the available information retention times/features are annotated to
standards using different confidence levels:

- **D** (lowest confidence): based on evidence 1: signal needs to be
  higher in samples with higher concentration of the standard. Measured m/z has
  to match the m/z of an ion of the compound.
- **C**: based on evidence 1 and 2. In addition to **D**, also the MS2
  spectrum for that feature needs to match with at least a low similarity to the
  reference spectra for that compound from HMDB.
- **B**: same as **C** but similarity to a reference spectrum for the standard
  is higher than 0.7.
- **A** (highest confidence): same as **B**, but the experimental MS2 spectrum
  does not match a MS2 spectrum from any other compound in HMDB or MassBank with
  a similarity > 0.7.

These confidence levels are for the annotation of the feature(s) to the
standard. Features with similar retention times and abundances across samples
(as well as eventually similar peak shapes) *inherit* the highest confidence
level from other features. 



# Discussion and open questions

## Neutral loss spectra

What is puzzling is that neutral loss spectra of e.g. `[M+Na]+` ions don't match
those of `[M+H]+` ions of the (potentially) same compound. Examples:

- matching neutral loss: 
  - mix01 serum pos, creatine: NL of `[M+2Na-H]+` ion matches NL reference
  spectra. `[M+Na]+` does however not. Also `[M+H]+` does not really match well.
  
- not matching neutral loss:
  - mix01 serum pos, acetylhistidine: NL `[M+H]+` and `[M+Na]+` don't match.
  - mix01 serum pos, L-Glutamic Acid: NL `[M+H]+` does not match `[M+2Na-H]+`,
    and `[M+Na]+` with a single peak.
  - mix01 serum pos, Xanthine: NL `[M+H]+`, `[M+K]+`, `[M+H-NH3]+`, `[M+Na]+`
    `[M+2Na-H]` all don't match.
