# Introduction

Mixes of standards have been solved in water or added to human serum sample
pools in two different concentration and these samples were measured with the
LC-MS setup from Eurac (used also to generate the CHRIS untargeted metabolomics
data). Assignment of retention time and observed ion can be performed for each
standard based on MS1 information such as expected m/z but also based on the
expected difference in signal between samples with low and high concentration of
the standards. Finally, experimental fragment spectra provide the third level of
evidence. Thus, the present data set allows to annotate features to standards
based on 3 levels of evidence: expected m/z, difference in measured intensity
and MS2-based annotation.

The goal of this analysis is to create an in-house reference library for
our untargeted LC-MS setup. For that we:

- determine the retention time of each standard in water and serum.
- define which ions/adducts are measured for each standard (with relative
  abundances, i.e. which is most highly abundant ion etc).
- extract all MS2 spectra for each standard, match them against reference
  spectra and store them in a database.

The approach consists of the following steps:

- First features are matched to (pre-defined) adducts of all standards within
  the mix based on their m/z value (evidence 1).
- Features are further restricted to those that have a higher signal in samples
  in which a higher concentration was used (evidence 2). These are further
  grouped based on their retention time (within 5 seconds) and similar abundance
  across samples (correlation > 0.6).
- MS2 spectra are extracted for all these features and similarities calculated
  against MS2 spectra for the respective compound from HMDB (evidence 3).
- The experimental MS2 spectra are in addition compared against all reference
  spectra from HMDB to evaluate their *specificity* against the standard.

Based on the available information retention times/features are annotated to
standards using different confidence levels:

- **D** (lowest confidence): based on evidence 1 and 2: signal needs to be
  higher in samples with higher concentration of the standard. Measured m/z has
  to match the m/z of an ion of the compound.
- **C**: based on evidence 1, 2 and 3. In addition to **D**, also the MS2
  spectrum for that feature needs to match with at least a low similarity to the
  reference spectra for that compound from HMDB.
- **B**: similarity to a reference spectrum for the standard is higher than 0.7.
- **A** (highest confidence): same as **B**, but the experimental MS2 spectrum
  does not match a MS2 spectrum from any other compound in HMDB or MassBank with
  a similarity > 0.7.

These confidence levels are for the annotation of the feature(s) to the
standard. Features with similar retention times and abundances across samples
(as well as eventually similar peak shapes) *inherit* the highest confidence
level from other features. 

We get all the standards, calculate their exact mass (based on their
formula) and subset to those from mix01.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
std_dilution <- read.table("data/standards_dilution.txt",
                           sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
std_dilution$exactmass <- calculateMass(std_dilution$formula)
colnames(std_dilution)[colnames(std_dilution) == "HMDB.code"] <- "HMDB"
std_dilution01 <- std_dilution[std_dilution$mix == mix, ]
```

The list of standards that constitute the present sample mix are listed below
along with the expected retention time and the most abundant adduct for positive
and negative polarity as defined manually in a previous analysis by Mar
Garcia-Aloy.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
pandoc.table(std_dilution01[, c("name", "formula", "HMDB", "RT", "POS", "NEG")], 
             style = "rmarkdown", split.tables = Inf,
             caption = paste0("Standards of ", mix_name, ". Columns RT, POS ",
                              "and NEG contain expected retention times and ",
                              "adducts from a previous manual analysis."))
```

# Data import

We next load the data and split it according to matrix and polarity.

```{r}
std_files <- read.table("data/std_serum_files.txt", header = TRUE)
std_files$concentration <- "blank"
std_files$concentration[grep("High", std_files$class)] <- "high"
std_files$concentration[grep("Low", std_files$class)] <- "low"
std_files$group <- std_files$concentration
std_files$group[grep("CE", std_files$mode)] <- "MSMS"

#' Define colors
col_group <- brewer.pal(9, "Set1")[c(1, 5, 4, 9)]
names(col_group) <- c("high", "low", "MSMS", "blank")

#' Subset and load data.
std_files <- std_files[which(std_files$type == mix_name), ]
fls <- paste0(MZML_PATH, std_files$folder, "/", std_files$mzML)
data <- readMSData(fls, pdata = new("NAnnotatedDataFrame", std_files),
                   mode = "onDisk")
data <- filterRt(data, rt = c(0, 350))
data <- filterEmptySpectra(data)

col_group <- col_group[unique(data$group)]
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# matrix_pol: matrix in which the standards are solved and polarity.
tmp <- rep("Water", length(fileNames(data)))
tmp[grep("^QC", data$class)] <- "Serum"
matrix_pol <- paste0(tmp, "_", data$polarity)
data$matrix_pol <- matrix_pol

data_WP <- filterFile(data, file = which(data$matrix_pol == "Water_POS"))
data_WN <- filterFile(data, file = which(data$matrix_pol == "Water_NEG"))
data_SP <- filterFile(data, file = which(data$matrix_pol == "Serum_POS"))
data_SN <- filterFile(data, file = which(data$matrix_pol == "Serum_NEG"))
```

We next also load the reference databases we will use to compare the
experimental MS2 spectra against. Below we thus load HMDB and MassBank data.

```{r}
register(SerialParam())
library(CompoundDb)

cdb <- CompDb("data/CompDb.Hsapiens.HMDB.5.0.sqlite")

library(MsBackendMassbank)
library(RSQLite)
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "data/MassBank.sqlite")
mbank <- Spectra(con, source = MsBackendMassbankSql())
```

# Initial evaluation of available MS2 data

Before performing the actual analysis that involves chromatographic peak
detection and evaluation of feature abundances, we compare all experimental MS2
spectra against the reference libraries. This provides already a first hint for
which standards a valid MS2 spectrum was recorded (and hence would allow
annotation based on evidence 3) and what related retention time might be.

We first extract all MS2 spectra from the respective data files and process them
by first removing all peaks with an intensity below 5% of the highest peak
signal, then scaling all intensities to a value range between 0 and 100 and
finally remove all MS2 spectra with less than 2 peaks.

```{r}
#' Functions to process the spectra
low_int <- function(x, ...) {
    x > max(x, na.rm = TRUE) * 0.05
}
scale_int <- function(x, ...) {
    maxint <- max(x[, "intensity"], na.rm = TRUE)
    x[, "intensity"] <- 100 * x[, "intensity"] / maxint
    x
}


fls <- fileNames(data_WP)
fls <- fls[grep("_CE", fls)]

all_ms2 <- Spectra(fls, source = MsBackendMzR()) |>
filterMsLevel(msLevel. = 2L) |>
filterIntensity(intensity = low_int)

all_ms2 <- all_ms2[lengths(all_ms2) > 1]
all_ms2 <- addProcessing(all_ms2, scale_int)
all_ms2 <- setBackend(all_ms2, MsBackendDataFrame())
all_ms2 <- applyProcessing(all_ms2)
```

We next match these spectra against all reference spectra from HMDB for the
standards in mix 01. All matching spectra with a similarity larger 0.7 are
identified.

```{r}
hmdb_std <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == std_dilution01$HMDB)
```

Standards for which no MS2 spectrum in HMDB is present are listed in the table
below.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
tmp <- std_dilution01[!(std_dilution01$HMDB %in% hmdb_std$compound_id), ]
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("name", "HMDB", "formula")], style = "rmarkdown",
             caption = "Standards for which no reference spectrum is available")
```

The table below lists all standards and the number of matching reference spectra
(along with their retention times).

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
all_match <- matchSpectra(
    hmdb_std, all_ms2,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
all_match <- all_match[whichQuery(all_match)]

tab <- matchedData(all_match, c("name", "compound_id", "score", "target_rtime"))

tmp <- split(as.data.frame(tab), tab$compound_id)
tmp <- do.call(rbind, lapply(tmp, function(z) {
    data.frame(name = z$name[1L],
               HMDB = z$compound_id[1L],
               ms2 = nrow(z),
               mean_rt = mean(z$target_rtime),
               min_rt = min(z$target_rtime),
               max_rt = max(z$target_rtime),
               mean_sim = mean(z$score))
}))
tmp <- rbindFill(
    tmp, std_dilution01[!std_dilution01$HMDB %in% tmp$HMDB, c("name", "HMDB")])
rownames(tmp) <- NULL
pandoc.table(tmp[order(tmp$name), ], style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
             caption = "Standards with matching reference MS2 spectra.")
```

We repeat the same analysis for the negative polarity data (code not shown
again).

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
fls <- fileNames(data_WN)
fls <- fls[grep("_CE", fls)]

all_ms2 <- Spectra(fls, source = MsBackendMzR()) |>
filterMsLevel(msLevel. = 2L) |>
filterIntensity(intensity = low_int)

all_ms2 <- all_ms2[lengths(all_ms2) > 1]
all_ms2 <- addProcessing(all_ms2, scale_int)
all_ms2 <- setBackend(all_ms2, MsBackendDataFrame())
all_ms2 <- applyProcessing(all_ms2)

all_match <- matchSpectra(
    hmdb_std, all_ms2,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
all_match <- all_match[whichQuery(all_match)]

tab <- matchedData(all_match, c("name", "compound_id", "score", "target_rtime"))

tmp <- split(as.data.frame(tab), tab$compound_id)
tmp <- do.call(rbind, lapply(tmp, function(z) {
    data.frame(name = z$name[1L],
               HMDB = z$compound_id[1L],
               ms2 = nrow(z),
               mean_rt = mean(z$target_rtime),
               min_rt = min(z$target_rtime),
               max_rt = max(z$target_rtime),
               mean_sim = mean(z$score))
}))
tmp <- rbindFill(
    tmp, std_dilution01[!std_dilution01$HMDB %in% tmp$HMDB, c("name", "HMDB")])
rownames(tmp) <- NULL
pandoc.table(tmp[order(tmp$name), ], style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
             caption = "Standards with matching reference MS2 spectra.")
```

We next perform the full analysis of the data set involving MS1 and MS2 data.

# Water, positive polarity

We first perform the analysis on the samples with the standards solved in pure
water acquired in positive polarity mode.

## Data pre-processing

We perform the pre-processing of our data set which consists of the
chromatographic peak detection followed by a peak refinement step to reduce peak
detection artifacts, the correspondence analysis to group peaks across samples
and finally the gap-filling to fill in missing peak data from samples in which
no chromatographic peak was detected.

Some notes on the settings for the pre-processing:

- The `bw` parameter for the correspondence is larger than usual because adding
  the standards in higher concentrations caused considerable retention time
  shifts for some. A higher `bw` will allow to group also mis-aligned
  chromatographic peaks - but will not allow to discriminate between closely
  eluting ions.
- The `binSize` was also slightly increased to avoid splitting of features with
  similar m/z values.

```{r peakdetection, eval = !file.exists(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "processed_data.RData"))}
## Peak detection
cwp <- CentWaveParam(ppm = 50,
                     peakwidth = c(2, 18),
                     snthresh = 5,
                     mzdiff = 0.001,
                     prefilter = c(4, 300),
                     noise = 100,
                     integrate = 2)

data_WP <- findChromPeaks(data_WP, param = cwp) 

## Peak refinement
mnp <- MergeNeighboringPeaksParam(expandRt = 3.5, expandMz = 0.001,
                                  minProp = 3/4)
data_WP <- refineChromPeaks(data_WP, param = mnp)

## Alignment
pdp1 <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_WP$matrix_pol, bw = 3,
                        minFraction = 0.7, binSize = 0.015)
data_WP <- groupChromPeaks(data_WP, param = pdp1)
pgp <- PeakGroupsParam(minFraction = 0.8, extraPeaks = 100, span = 0.8)
data_WP <- adjustRtime(data_WP, param = pgp)

## Correspondence analysis
pdp2 <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_WP$mode, bw = 3,
                        minFraction = 0.3, binSize = 0.015)
data_WP <- groupChromPeaks(data_WP, param = pdp2)

## Gap-filling
data_WP <- fillChromPeaks(data_WP, param = ChromPeakAreaParam())
save(data_WP, file = paste0(RDATA_PATH, "processed_data.RData"))
```

```{r correspondence-cached, echo = FALSE, eval = file.exists(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "processed_data.RData"))}
load(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "processed_data.RData"))
```

The base peak chromatogram and peak density image with the expected retention
times for the standards is shown below.

```{r mix01-water-pos-bpc, echo = FALSE, caption = "Base peak chromatogram and chromatographic peak density image. Dashed vertical lines represent the expected retention times for the standards as defined in a previous manual analysis.", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
bpc <- chromatogram(data_WP, aggregationFun = "max", msLevel = 1L,
                    mz = c(60, 900), include = "none")
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 20, 1.5, 0.5))
plot(bpc, col = paste0(col_group[bpc$group], 80))
legend("topright", col = col_group, lty = 1, legend = names(col_group))
abline(v = std_dilution01$RT, lty = 2)
par(mar = c(4.5, 20, 0, 0.5))
plotChromPeakImage(data_WP, binSize = 3)
abline(v = std_dilution01$RT, lty = 2)
```

There is a clear difference in the signal of samples with high and low
concentration of the standards.


## Signal intensity difference

We compute the difference in (log2) signals between samples with high and low
concentration of the standards and calculate the p-value for this difference
using the Student's t-test.

```{r}
fVlog2 <- log2(featureValues(data_WP, value = "into",
                             method = "sum", filled = TRUE))
high <- grep("High", colnames(fVlog2))
high <- high[-grep("CE", colnames(fVlog2)[high])]
low <- grep("Low", colnames(fVlog2))

ttest <- t(apply(fVlog2, 1, function(x) {
    a <- x[high]
    b <- x[low]
    if (sum(!is.na(a)) > 1 && sum(!is.na(b)) > 1) {
        res <- t.test(a, b, mu = 0)
        c(high_low_diff = unname(res$estimate[1] - res$estimate[2]),
          pvalue = res$p.value, mean_high = mean(a, na.rm = TRUE),
          mean_low = mean(b, na.rm = TRUE))
    } else c(high_low_diff = mean(a, na.rm = TRUE) - mean(b, na.rm = TRUE),
             pvalue = NA_real_, mean_high = mean(a, na.rm = TRUE),
             mean_low = mean(b, na.rm = TRUE))
}))
```


## Identification of features matching standards

We now identify all features matching likely adducts of the standards.

```{r}
adducts <- c("[M+H]+", "[M+2H]2+", "[M+Na]+", "[M+K]+", "[M+NH4]+",
             "[M+H-H2O]+", "[M+H+Na]2+", "[M+2Na]2+", "[M+H-NH3]+")
prm <- Mass2MzParam(adducts = adducts, ppm = 30)
fmat <- c(featureDefinitions(data_WP), ttest)
mtchs <- matchMz(fmat, std_dilution01, param =  prm, mzColname = "mzmed")
mtchs_sub <- mtchs[whichQuery(mtchs)]
```

We further reduce to features that show an at least twice as high signal
in samples with the high concentration compared to the one with the low
concentration. Note that we also keep features for which no difference was
calculated (e.g. because in low concentration no signal was measured).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mD <- matchedData(mtchs_sub, columns = c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed",
                                         "target_RT", "target_name",
                                         "target_HMDB",
                                         "adduct", "target_POS",
                                         "high_low_diff", "pvalue",
                                         "mean_high", "mean_low"))
mD <- mD[-which(mD$high_low_diff < 1), ]
mD <- mD[order(mD$target_name), ]
```

for most of the standards (`r length(unique(mD$target_name))` out of 
`r nrow(std_dilution01)`) in mix `r mix` at least one feature was found
matching the standards adducts' m/z. 

Below we plot the BPC indicating the position of the assigned features.

```{r mix01-water-pos-bpc-matched, echo = FALSE, caption = "Base peak chromatogram with position of features assigned to standards.", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
plot(bpc, col = paste0(col_group[bpc$group], 80))
legend("topright", col = col_group, lty = 1, legend = names(col_group))
abline(v = mD$rtmed, lty = 2, col = "#00000080")
```

Position of some of the matching features overlap with regions in the BPC that
exhibit a large difference in signal between high and low concentration.
The standards with no match are reported below.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
pandoc.table(std_dilution01[!std_dilution01$name %in% mD$target_name,
                            c("name", "HMDB", "formula", "RT", "POS", "NEG")],
             style = "rmarkdown", split.tables = Inf,
             caption = "Not matched standards")
```

In the next sections we investigate for each standard which assignment would be
the correct one or, for those for which no signal was detected, why that was the
case.

## Standards with matching features

While for some standards a matching feature was found we still need to evaluate
whether this matching is correct. For each standard we thus first evaluate the
EICs for all matching features, then we match their MS2 spectra (if available)
against reference libraries. To ensure correct assignment of a feature, its
retention time and eventually related MS2 spectra, we consider the following
criteria to determine the annotation confidence:

- feature(s) was/were found with m/z matching those of adduct(s) of the 
  standard.
- signal is higher for samples with higher concentration.
- MS2 spectra matches reference spectra for the standard (if available).
- MS2 spectra don't match MS2 spectra of other compounds.



```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "3-Phosphoglyceric Acid"
```

### 3-Phosphoglyceric Acid


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
data_WP_FS <- filterFile(data_WP, which(data_WP$mode == "FS"),
                         keepFeatures = TRUE)

#' helper function to group features and return their feature group IDs.
group_features <- function(x, features, groupEic = FALSE) {
    featureGroups(x) <- rep(NA, nrow(featureDefinitions(x)))
    featureGroups(x)[rownames(featureDefinitions(x)) %in% features] <- "FG"
    x <- groupFeatures(x, param = SimilarRtimeParam(5))
    x <- groupFeatures(x, param = AbundanceSimilarityParam(threshold = 0.6,
                                                           transform = log2))
    if (groupEic)
        x <- groupFeatures(x, param = EicSimilarityParam(threshold = 0.5,
                                                         n = 3))
    featureGroups(x)[match(features, rownames(featureDefinitions(x)))]
}

tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

A considerable number of features has been assigned to this standard based on
m/z matching. Based on their retention times, these seem however to represent
ions from two different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics <- function(x, std, tab, MP) {
    eics <- featureChromatograms(x, features = rownames(tab))
    dr <- file.path(IMAGE_PATH, std)
    dir.create(dr, showWarnings = FALSE)
    col_sample <- col_group[eics$group]

    for (i in seq_len(nrow(eics))) {
        ft <- rownames(tab)[i]
        fl <- file.path(dr, paste0(MP,"_", ft, ".png"))
        png(fl, width = 12, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 300, pointsize = 6)
        eic <- eics[i, ]
        plot(eic, col = paste0(col_sample, 80),
             peakBg = paste0(col_sample[chromPeaks(eic)[, "sample"]], 40))
        abline(v = tab$target_RT[1], lty = 2, col = "#00000060")
        grid()
        legend("topleft", c(std, tab$adduct[i], ft))
        legend("topright", col = col_group, legend = names(col_group), lty = 1)
        dev.off()
    }
}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

Next we extract the MS2 spectra for all features and clean them (i.e. remove
peaks with an intensity below 5% of the maximum peak and removing spectra with
less than 2 peaks.

```{r}
extract_ms2 <- function(x, features) {
    res <- featureSpectra(x, expandRt = 3, return.type = "Spectra",
                          features = features)
    res <- filterIntensity(res, intensity = low_int)
    res <- res[lengths(res) > 1]
    if (!length(res))
        return(res)
    res <- addProcessing(res, scale_int)
    spectraNames(res) <- paste0(res$feature_id, "_", spectraNames(res))
    res
}

std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
```

The MS2 spectra are shown below.

```{r mix01-water-3-phosphoglyceric-acid-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to 3-Phosphoglyceric Acid.", echo = FALSE}
par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
```

The MS2 spectra look rather busy with a large number of peaks. The first two
belong to the first set of features with a retention time of about 250, the 3rd
one to the second set of features with a retention time of ~ 200.

We next match the extracted MS2 spectra against the reference spectra for 
`r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-3-phosphoglyceric-acid-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for 3-Phoshoglyceric Acid from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectra for FT1539 match those of 3-Phosphoglyceric Acid, albeit with a
low similarity score while the MS2 spectrum for FT1793 does not match the
reference spectra.

The first two spectra match MS2 spectra for `r std` from HMDB with a similarity
of about 0.2. These are shown in the mirror plots below.

```{r mix01-water-3-phosphoglyceric-acid-mirror-hmdb, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
#' helper function that selects experimental MS2 spectra (std_ms2) with a
#' similarity higher than the specified cutoff, creates mirror plots and
#' returns the selected `Spectra`.
#'
#' This function uses *global* variables `sim`, `std_ms2` and `hmdb`
plot_select_ms2 <- function(cutoff) {
    idx <- which(sim > cutoff, arr.ind = TRUE)

    par(mfrow = c(round(sqrt(nrow(idx))), ceiling(sqrt(nrow(idx)))))
    for (i in seq_len(nrow(idx))) {
        a <- idx[i, 1L]
        b <- idx[i, 2L]
        plotSpectraMirror(std_ms2[a], addProcessing(hmdb[b], scale_int),
                          main = paste(spectraNames(std_ms2)[a], hmdb$name[b]),
                          ppm = 40)
    }
    std_ms2[unique(idx[, "row"])]
}

std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.2)

```

Although not perfect, it seems that feature FT1539 contains signal from an ion
of `r std`.

In addition we match (**all**) the MS2 spectra for the matched features against
all spectra from HMDB identifying reference spectra with a similarity larger
than 0.7. This is to ensure that no reference spectra from any other compound
would match the extracted spectra for this feature with a higher similarity.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

No spectrum in HMDB matches any of the input spectra with a similarity higher
than 0.7. We next we compare the experimental MS2 spectra against MassBank.

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

Also for MassBank no match was found.

#### Summary

- Annotation of FT1539 (RT=250, `[M+H]+` ion) to `r std` with confidence level
  **B**.
- Annotation of FT1749 (RT=250, `[M+NH4]+` ion] to `r std` with confidence level
  **B-**.
- Reference MS2: F07.S0836, F08.S0767 (with a *low* grading?)


```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Acetylhistidine"
```

### Acetylhistidine

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from tentatively 3 different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-acetylhistidine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to acetylhistidine.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
```

We have thus MS2 spectra for each set of features. Next we compare them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB. The results are shown in the
heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-acetylhistidine-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for Acetylhistidine from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectra for FT1643 have the highest similarity against MS2 spectra from
`r std`. Mirror plots for the best matching spectra are shown below.

```{r mix01-water-acetylhistidine-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.6)
```

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
match_table <- function(x, sv = c("rtime", "target_name", "score")) {
    x <- x[whichQuery(x)]
    tab <- spectraData(x, c("feature_id", sv))
    rn <- strsplit(rownames(tab), "_")
    rn <- vapply(rn, function(z) z[2L], character(1))
    tab$spectrum_id <- rn
    fids <- split(tab$feature_id, tab$spectrum_id)
    fids <- vapply(fids, function(z) paste0(unique(z), collapse = ";"),
                   character(1))
    tab <- as.data.frame(tab)
    rownames(tab) <- NULL
    tab <- unique(tab[, c(sv, "spectrum_id")])
    tab$feature_id <- fids[tab$spectrum_id]
    tab
}

summarize_match_table <- function(x, name = "target_name") {
    f <- paste(x[, name], x$spectrum_id)
    x <- lapply(split(x, f), function(z)
        z[order(z$score, decreasing = TRUE), ][1, ])
    x <- do.call(rbind, x)
    x <- x[order(x$score, decreasing = TRUE), ]
    x$selected <- rep("", nrow(x))
    sel_ids <- vapply(strsplit(spectraNames(std_ms2_sel), "_"),
                      function(z) z[2], character(1))
    x$selected[x$spectrum_id %in% sel_ids] <- "X"
    rownames(x) <- NULL
    x
}

st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

The features with a retention time of about 37 seconds are clearly not `r std`
while those with a retention time of about 180 seconds seem to represent signal
for that compound, even if their MS2 spectra match also reference spectra from
other compounds.

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```


#### Summary

- FT1643 (RT=177.8, `[M+H]+` ion) matches MS2 spectra of `r std` but also
  those of others: confidence **B**.
- FT1925 (RT=177.9, `[M+Na]+` ion); confidence **B-**.
- FT1433 (RT=178.6, `[M+H-H2O]` ion); confidence **B-**.
- Reference MS2: F07.S0518, F08.S0425 and F08.S0506.


### Betaine

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Betaine"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from several different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-betaine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to betaine.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
```

We have thus only MS2 spectra for features with a retention time around 160 or
180 seconds. Next we compare them against the reference spectra for `r std` from
HMDB. The results are shown in the heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-betaine-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for Betaine from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

Only the MS2 spectrum for FT0544 (F08.S0371, with a retention time of 162) match
the reference spectra from betaine.

```{r mix01-water-betaine-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.6)
```

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

Thus, the MS2 spectra for feature FT0544 clearly match Betaine.

#### Summary

- MS2 spectra for FT0544 (RT=162.3, `[M+H]+` ion) matches `r std` with
  confidence **B** - or should we use **A** because the matches to other
  compounds have considerably lower similarity or are highly unlikely.
- FT0877 (RT=163.3, `[M+Na]+` ion) matches with **B-**.
- Reference MS2: F08.S0371.


### C3 Carnitine

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "C3 Carnitine"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from two different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-c3-carnitine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to C3 Carnitine.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

Unfortunately we don't have any MS2 spectra available. Maybe there are some for
negative polarity which would then help us defining the *correct* retention
time.

#### Summary

- FT2112 (RT=162.6, `[M+NH4]+`): confidence level **D**. Justify based on not
  possible adduct and polarity.


### CDP

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "CDP"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from several (7/8?) different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-CDP-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to CDP", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))

if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

We haven't found any MS2 spectra for the features features matched to `r std`.

#### Summary

- too many possible features. Consider negative polarity.

### Creatine

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Creatine"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from 6 different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-creatine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to creatine", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
```

We have thus MS2 spectra for features with a retention time around 67 and 177.
Next we compare them against the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.
The results are shown in the heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-creatine-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for creatine from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectra for FT0752 have the highest similarity against MS2 spectra from
`r std`. Mirror plots for the best matching spectra are shown below.

```{r mix01-water-creatine-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.6)
```

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = length(whichQuery(mbank_match)) > 0}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

The feature with a retention time around 177 seconds (FT0752) seem to represent
signal from `r std` (being only matched to `r std` and with a high score).

#### Summary

- FT0752 (RT=177.8, `[M+H]+` ion): confidence **A**: the MS2 spectrum F07.S0424
  matches only `r std`.
- FT1119 (RT=177, `[M+Na]+` ion): confidence **A-**.
- Reference MS2: F07.S0424, F08.S0420.
- Interestingly, we seem to have Creatinine also present (FT0479, RT=56).
- Add spectrum F07.S0424 as reference MS2 spectrum for `r std`.


### Dimethylglycine

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Dimethylglycine"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from several different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-dimethylglycine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to dimethylglycine", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    plotSpectra(std_ms2)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

Unfortunately no MS2 spectra is available.

#### Summary

- we can not assign one of the features properly. Likely it's the ones with
  an RT around 177. Maybe there is something in negative polarity.
- an MS2 spectrum with a retention time of 182 seconds matches
  N,N-Dimethylglycine from MassBank if we compare neutral loss spectra.


### Glycerol

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Glycerol"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from 6 different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-glycerol-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to glycerol", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    plotSpectra(std_ms2)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

Unfortunately no MS2 spectra is available.

#### Summary

- again, no there are quite some candidates and it's not possible to select
  one.
- Evaluating the EICs it seems `r std` can not be detected in the present
  samples.


### L-Glutamic Acid

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "L-Glutamic Acid"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from several different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-L-Glutamic-Acid-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to L-Glutamic Acid.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

We have thus MS2 spectra for features shown above plus FT1307 (second and
third plot).
Next we compare them against the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB. The
results are shown in the heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-L-Glutamic-Acid-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for L-Glutamic Acid from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectra for FT1018, FT1020, FT0693, FT0694 have quite high similarity
against MS2 spectra from `r std`. Mirror plots for the best matching spectra
(similarity higher than 0.9) are shown below. Note also that some MS2 spectra
are assigned to multiple features.

```{r mix01-water-L-Glutamic-Acid-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.9)
```

Thus, the best matching spectra are F07.S0508, F07.S0619 and F08.S0622. The
associated features are *FT1018*, *FT1020*. Looking at the EICs of these it is
evident that *FT1020* should be ignored.

![](images/match-standards-water-mix01/L-Glutamic Acid/WP_FT1020.png)

Those most likely representing `r std` are:

![](images/match-standards-water-mix01/L-Glutamic Acid/WP_FT0693.png)

![](images/match-standards-water-mix01/L-Glutamic Acid/WP_FT1018.png)

![](images/match-standards-water-mix01/L-Glutamic Acid/WP_FT1307.png)

The retention time for all 3 of them is about 183 seconds.

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
  std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
  param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = length(whichQuery(mbank_match)) > 0}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

MS2 spectra associated to feature FT0693, FT1018 have been matched to reference
spectra from L-Glutamic Acid but also from other compounds with relatively high
scores in both cases.

#### Summary

- FT1018 (RT=183.8, `[M+H]+` ion): confidence level **B**. Its MS2 spectrum
  (F07.S0508) matches `r std`, but also other compounds.
- FT0693 (RT=182.6, `[M+H-H2O]+`] ion): confidence level **B-**.
- FT1307 (RT=182.3, `[M+Na]+` ion): confidence level **B-**.
- FT0730 (RT=182.6, `[M+H-NH3]+` ion): confidence level **B-**.
- Reference MS2: F07.S0508, F07.S0619 and F08.S0622.


### Myo-Inositol

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Myo-Inositol"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from 6 different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-myo-inositol-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to myo-inositol.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

We have thus MS2 spectra for each set of features. Next we compare them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB. The results are shown in the
heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-myo-inositol-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for myo-inositol from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectrum for FT1450 have a high similarity against some MS2 spectra from
`r std`. Mirror plots for the best matching spectra are shown below.

```{r mix01-water-myo-inositol-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.6)
```

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
  std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
  param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

MS2 spectra from FT1450 are matched to `r std` and to other compounds as well
(1,2-Dimethoxybenzene, L-Quebrachitol) but generally with lower scores.

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = length(whichQuery(mbank_match)) > 0}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```


#### Summary

- FT1450 (RT=193.8, `[M+H]+` ion): confidence level **C** (or **B** because
  there is no additional match???).
- FT1256 (RT=194.4, `[M+H-H2O]+` ion): confidence level **C-**.
- FT1733 (RT 194.2, `[M+Na]+` ion). Problem is
  that two MS2 spectra are assigned, neither of which matches myo-Inositol!
  Needs to be discussed!
- Reference MS2: F08.S0532.


### Pyruvic Acid

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Pyruvic Acid"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Only FT0348 was matched to `r std`.

We next plot the EIC for the this feature and show it below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next look if there are MS2 spectra associated to this feature but we don't
find any.

```{r mix01-water-pyruvic-acid-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to pyruvic-acid", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    plotSpectra(std_ms2)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```


#### Summary

- Seems we can not detect `r std` in the present samples.


### Suberic Acid

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Suberic Acid"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from 3(or 4?) different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-suberic-acid-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to suberic acid.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
```

We have thus MS2 spectra for features around 37 and 140. Next we compare them
against the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB. The results are shown in
the heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-suberic-acid-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for suberic acid from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

Strangely every match has score equal to 0.

We look if there's any match for the MS2 spectra for the matched features
against all spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
  std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
  param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

The MS2 spectra for 137 seconds match with a high similarity reference spectra
for 1-Methylxanthine, but not `r std`.

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = length(whichQuery(mbank_match)) > 0}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```


#### Summary

- this is puzzling. FT1375 (RT=37.32, `[M+H]+` ion), FT1633 (RT=37.38,
  `[M+Na]+` ion), FT1585 (RT=37.25, `[M+NH4]+` ion) and FT1831 (RT=37.17,
  `[M+K]+` ion) all would match with confidence **C** but the MS2 spectrum for
  FT1633 does not match `r std`.
- Could this be that the reference in HMDB is bad?
- Should we try with the neutral loss approach???
  

### Xanthine

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Xanthine"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD[mD$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WP_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from a single compound.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WP, std, tmp, "WP")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-xanthine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to xanthine", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WP, rownames(tmp))
par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
```

We have thus MS2 spectra for the set of features with retention time around 140.
Next we compare them against the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB. The
results are shown in the heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-xanthine-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for xanthine from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectra for FT1102 have the highest similarity against MS2 spectra from
`r std`. Mirror plots for the best matching spectra are shown below.

```{r mix01-water-xanthine-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.6)
```

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
  std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
  param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

MS2 spectra from FT1102 are assigned also to oxypurinol besides xanthine with
similar (or slightly better) scores.

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))

## Standards without any matching feature

### propionic acid
### Uric acid

# Water, negative polarity

We now perform the analysis on the samples with the standards still solved in
pure water but acquired in negative polarity mode.

## Data pre-processing

We perform the pre-processing of these samples (using the same settings as in
water, positive polarity).

```{r peakdetection-water-neg, eval = !file.exists(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "processed_data_WN.RData"))}
## Peak detection
cwp <- CentWaveParam(ppm = 50,
                     peakwidth = c(2, 18),
                     snthresh = 5,
                     mzdiff = 0.001,
                     prefilter = c(4, 300),
                     noise = 100,
                     integrate = 2)

data_WN <- findChromPeaks(data_WN, param = cwp) 

## Peak refinement
mnp <- MergeNeighboringPeaksParam(expandRt = 3.5, expandMz = 0.001,
                                  minProp = 3/4)
data_WN <- refineChromPeaks(data_WN, param = mnp)

## Alignment
pdp1 <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_WN$matrix_pol, bw = 3,
                        minFraction = 0.7, binSize = 0.015)
data_WN <- groupChromPeaks(data_WN, param = pdp1)
pgp <- PeakGroupsParam(minFraction = 0.8, extraPeaks = 100, span = 0.8)
data_WN <- adjustRtime(data_WN, param = pgp)

## Correspondence analysis
pdp2 <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_WN$mode, bw = 3,
                        minFraction = 0.3, binSize = 0.015)
data_WN <- groupChromPeaks(data_WN, param = pdp2)

## Gap-filling
data_WN <- fillChromPeaks(data_WN, param = ChromPeakAreaParam())
save(data_WN, file = paste0(RDATA_PATH, "processed_data_WN.RData"))
```

```{r correspondence-cached-water-neg, echo = FALSE, eval = file.exists(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "processed_data_WN.RData"))}
load(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "processed_data_WN.RData"))
```

The base peak chromatogram and peak density image with the expected retention
times for the standards is shown below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-bpc, echo = FALSE, caption = "Base peak chromatogram and chromatographic peak density image. Dashed vertical lines represent the expected retention times for the standards as defined in a previous manual analysis.", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
bpc_WN <- chromatogram(data_WN, aggregationFun = "max", msLevel = 1L,
                    mz = c(60, 900), include = "none")
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 20, 1.5, 0.5))
plot(bpc_WN, col = paste0(col_group[bpc_WN$group], 80))
legend("topright", col = col_group, lty = 1, legend = names(col_group))
abline(v = std_dilution01$RT, lty = 2)
par(mar = c(4.5, 20, 0, 0.5))
plotChromPeakImage(data_WN, binSize = 3)
abline(v = std_dilution01$RT, lty = 2)
```


## Signal intensity difference

We compute the difference in (log2) signals between samples with high and low
concentration of the standards and calculate the p-value for this difference
using the Student's t-test.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fVlog2_WN <- log2(featureValues(data_WN, value = "into",
                             method = "sum", filled = TRUE))
high_WN <- grep("High", colnames(fVlog2_WN))
high_WN <- high_WN[-grep("CE", colnames(fVlog2_WN)[high_WN])]
low_WN <- grep("Low", colnames(fVlog2_WN))

ttest_WN <- t(apply(fVlog2_WN, 1, function(x) {
    a <- x[high_WN]
    b <- x[low_WN]
    if (sum(!is.na(a)) > 1 && sum(!is.na(b)) > 1) {
        res <- t.test(a, b, mu = 0)
        c(high_low_diff = unname(res$estimate[1] - res$estimate[2]),
          pvalue = res$p.value, mean_high = mean(a, na.rm = TRUE),
          mean_low = mean(b, na.rm = TRUE))
    } else c(high_low_diff = mean(a, na.rm = TRUE) - mean(b, na.rm = TRUE),
             pvalue = NA_real_, mean_high = mean(a, na.rm = TRUE),
             mean_low = mean(b, na.rm = TRUE))
}))
```


## Identification of features matching standards

We now identify all features matching likely adducts of the standards.

```{r}
adducts_N <- adducts("negative")[c("[M-H]-", "[M+Cl]-"),
                                 c("mass_multi", "mass_add")]
adducts_N <- rbind(adducts_N, "[M+HCOO]-" = c(1, calculateMass("HCOO"))) 
prm_WN <- Mass2MzParam(adducts = adducts_N, ppm = 30)
fmat_WN <- c(featureDefinitions(data_WN), ttest_WN)
mtchs_WN <- matchMz(fmat_WN, std_dilution01, param = prm_WN, mzColname = "mzmed")
mtchs_sub_WN <- mtchs_WN[whichQuery(mtchs_WN)]
```

We further reduce to features that show an at least twice as high signal
in samples with the high concentration compared to the one with the low
concentration. Note that we also keep features for which no difference was
calculated (e.g. because in low concentration no signal was measured).

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
mD_WN <- matchedData(mtchs_sub_WN, columns = c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed",
                                               "target_RT", "target_name",
                                               "target_HMDB",
                                               "adduct", "target_NEG",
                                               "high_low_diff", "pvalue",
                                               "mean_low", "mean_high"))
mD_WN <- mD_WN[-which(mD_WN$high_low_diff < 1), ]
mD_WN <- mD_WN[order(mD_WN$target_name), ]
```

For most of the standards (`r length(unique(mD_WN$target_name))` out of 
`r nrow(std_dilution01)`) in mix `r mix` at least one feature was found
matching the standards adducts' m/z. 

Below we plot the BPC indicating the position of the assigned features.

```{r mix01-water-neg-bpc-matched, echo = FALSE, caption = "Base peak chromatogram with position of features assigned to standards.", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
plot(bpc_WN, peakType = "none", col = paste0(col_group[bpc_WN$group], 80))
legend("topright", col = col_group, lty = 1, legend = names(col_group))
abline(v = mD_WN$rtmed, lty = 2, col = "#00000080")
```

Position of some of the matching features overlap with regions in the BPC that
exhibit a large difference in signal between high and low concentration.
The standards with no match are reported below.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
pandoc.table(std_dilution01[!std_dilution01$name %in% mD_WN$target_name,
                            c("name", "formula", "RT", "POS", "NEG")],
             style = "rmarkdown", split.tables = Inf,
             caption = "Not matched standards")
```

In the next sections we investigate for each standard which assignment would be
the correct one or, for those for which no signal was detected, why that was the
case.

## Standards with matching features

### 3-Phosphoglyceric Acid

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "3-Phosphoglyceric Acid"
```

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
data_WN_FS <- filterFile(data_WN, which(data_WN$mode == "FS"),
                         keepFeatures = TRUE)
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Only two features has been assigned to this standard based on m/z matching.
Based on their retention times, these seem however to represent
ions from two different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

Next we extract the MS2 spectra for all features, clean and plot them.

```{r mix01-water-neg-3-phosphoglyceric-acid-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to 3-Phosphoglyceric Acid.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))
par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
```

The MS2 spectra seem to belong to the first set of features with a retention
time of about 240.

We next match the extracted MS2 spectra against the reference spectra for 
`r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-neg-3-phosphoglyceric-acid-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for 3-Phoshoglyceric Acid from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectra for FT0577 match some spectra from 3-Phosphoglyceric Acid with
high score.

These are shown in the mirror plots below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-3-phosphoglyceric-acid-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.7)
```

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB identifying reference spectra with a similarity larger than
0.7. This is to ensure that no reference spectra from any other compound would
match the extracted spectra for this feature with a higher similarity.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

There are many matches also for other HMDB compounds. These have mostly lower
scores than those for `r std` exept a few higher scores.

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = length(whichQuery(mbank_match)) > 0}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```


#### Summary

- FT0557 (RT=247.4, `[M-H]-` ion): confidence level **B**.
- Reference MS2: F15.S0708.


### Acetylhistidine

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Acetylhistidine"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]

tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from several different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

```{r mix01-water-neg-acetylhistidine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to acetylhistidine.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))
par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)

```

We have thus MS2 spectra for features with retention time around 180 and 194.
Next we compare them against the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.
The results are shown in the heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-acetylhistidine-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for Acetylhistidine from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectra for both features FT0620 and FT0623 have a quite high similarity
against MS2 some spectra from `r std`. Mirror plots for the best matching
spectra are shown below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-acetylhistidine-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.7)
```

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

Both features FT0620 and FT0623 are matched also carnosine.

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = length(whichQuery(mbank_match)) > 0}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```


#### Summary

Puzzling situation: needs to be discussed! We have two different features, same
ion, that match the standard (with same confidence level).

- FT0620 (RT=180.9, `[M-H]-` ion): confidence level **B**. MS2 spectra match
  also carnosine.
- FT0623 (RT=193.9, `[M-H]-` ion): confidence level **B**. MS2 spectra match
  also carnosine.
- Reference MS2: FT0620: F15.S0417, F16.S0409, FT0623: F15.S0497, F16.S0478.
- In positive polarity we have features with confidence level **B** at an
  RT=177, thus we might use FT0620, or maybe add both ions?


### Betaine

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Betaine"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from the same compound.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tab = tmp, "WN")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-neg-betaine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to betaine.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))

if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

#### Summary

- FT0323 (RT=162.7, `[M+Cl]-` ion): confidence level **D** or inherit from
  positive polarity, since retention time and EIC look similar?
- FT0386 (RT=162.7, `[M+HCOO]-` ion): confidence level as above.


### CDP

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "CDP"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from several different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, MP = "WN")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-neg-CDP-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to CDP", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))

if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

We haven't found any MS2 spectra for the features features matched to `r std`.

#### Summary

- Same as positive polarity. Not clear what it could be without any MS2
  spectrum.


### Creatine

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Creatine"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from 2 different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-neg-creatine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to creatine", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))

if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

We haven't found any MS2 spectra for the features features matched to `r std`.

#### Summary

- FT0180 (RT=176.7, `[M-H]-` ion): confidence level **D** or inherit from
  positive mode?


### Dimethylglycine

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Dimethylglycine"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

We next plot the EIC for the only feature matched to `r std` and show it below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-neg-dimethylglycine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to dimethylglycine", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

Unfortunately no MS2 spectra associated to FT0052 is available.

#### Summary

- FT0052 (RT=181.6, `[M-H]-` ion): confidence level **D**.


### Glycerol

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Glycerol"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Also for `r std` we have only one match. We next plot the and show the EIC
of the realted feature.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-neg-glycerol-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to glycerol", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

Unfortunately no MS2 spectra is available.

#### Summary

- very low signal. Seems nothing properly detected.


### L-Glutamic Acid

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "L-Glutamic Acid"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from 3 different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

Note: FT0269 and FT0270 are actually the same signal, FT0270 contains the peaks
in low concentration, FT0269 those in high concentration. We should thus focus
on FT0269.

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-neg-L-Glutamic-Acid-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to L-Glutamic Acid.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

Next we compare them against the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB. The
results are shown in the heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-L-Glutamic-Acid-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for L-Glutamic Acid from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectra for FT0269 and even more so for FT070 have quite high similarity
against some MS2 spectra from `r std`. Mirror plots for the best matching
spectra (similarity higher than 0.8) are shown below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-L-Glutamic-Acid-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.8)
```

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
  std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
  param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

Among the matches involving spectra from FT0270 those against spectra from
`r std` have the highest scores. Instead for FT0269 we have a better match
against DL-Glutamate than those against 

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = length(whichQuery(mbank_match)) > 0}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```


#### Summary

- FT0269 and FT0270 both represent the same compound, but retention times
  shifted for low and high concentration (RT=180, `[M-H]-` ion): confidence
  level **B**.
- Reference MS2: F15.S0436, F16.S0428.


### Myo-Inositol

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Myo-Inositol"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from 6 different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-neg-myo-inositol-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to myo-inositol.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

We have thus MS2 spectra for features with an RT of 194. Next we compare them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB. The results are shown in the
heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-myo-inositol-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for myo-inositol from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectra for FT0813 have a high similarity against some MS2 spectra from
`r std`. Mirror plots for the best matching spectra are shown below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-myo-inositol-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.8)
```

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
  std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
  param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

The matches involve other compounds than `r std` but some of those for `r std`
have the higher score.

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = length(whichQuery(mbank_match)) > 0}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```


#### Summary

- FT0813 (RT=193.9, `[M+HCOO]-` ion): confidence level **B**.
- FT0499 (RT=193.7, `[M-H]-` ion): confidence level **B-**
- Reference MS2: F15.S0498.


### Pyruvic Acid


```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Pyruvic Acid"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from 2 different compounds.

Again, we show a representative EIC for both *feature groups* (ordered by
retention time).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

We next look if there are MS2 spectra associated to the above features.

```{r mix01-water-neg-pyruvic-acid-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to pyruvic-acid", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))
if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

Next we compare them against the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB. The
results are shown below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-pyruvic-acid-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, echo = TRUE}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40, SIMPLIFY = FALSE)
sim
```

Thus, the MS2 spectrum for FT0023 does not match any reference spectra for 
`r std` from HMDB.

We match the above MS2 spectrum against all spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
  std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
  param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

No match involving `r std` was found but similarity with MS2 spectra for
Ascorbic acid are high.

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = length(whichQuery(mbank_match)) > 0}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```


#### Summary

- FT0023 (RT=41.91, `[M-H]-` ion) is the only signal for the expected
  m/z. However, the associated MS2 spectrum F16.S0125 does not match any
  reference spectra for `r std`, but those for Ascorbic acid.
- FT0205 (RT=41.15, `[M+HCOO]-` ion): confidence level **C** or inherit from
  above?
- How should we deal with this???
- Check in addition MetLin spectrum?
- Check in addition MoNA spectra?


### Suberic Acid

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Suberic Acid"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from 3(or 4?) different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-neg-suberic-acid-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to suberic acid.", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))
par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
```

We have thus MS2 spectra for features around 37 and 140. Next we compare them
against the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB. The results are shown in
the heatmap below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-suberic-acid-ms2-hmdb-heatmap, fig.cap = "Similarities of MS2 spectra for selected features against reference spectra for suberic acid from HMDB.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hmdb_id <- std_dilution$HMDB[std_dilution$name == std]
hmdb <- Spectra(cdb, filter = ~ compound_id == hmdb_id)

sim <- compareSpectra(std_ms2, hmdb, ppm = 40)

ann <- data.frame(feature_id = std_ms2$feature_id, rt = rtime(std_ms2))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(sim)

pheatmap(sim, annotation_row = ann, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101),
         color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "YlOrRd")))(100))
```

The MS2 spectrum F15.S0115 (for feature FT0428) has the highest similarity
against MS2 spectra from `r std`. Mirror plots for the best matching spectra are
shown below.

```{r mix01-water-neg-suberic-acid-mirror-hmdb, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Mirror plots"}
std_ms2_sel <- plot_select_ms2(0.7)
```

In addition we match the MS2 spectra for the matched features against all
spectra from HMDB.

```{r}
hmdb_match <- matchSpectra(
  std_ms2, Spectra(cdb),
  param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
hmdb_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
st <- match_table(hmdb_match) |>
summarize_match_table()
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```

MS2 spectra associated with FT0428 have been assigned only to `r std` and with
high scores.

```{r}
mbank_match <- matchSpectra(
    std_ms2, mbank,
    param = CompareSpectraParam(ppm = 40, requirePrecursor = FALSE))
mbank_match
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = length(whichQuery(mbank_match)) > 0}
st <- match_table(mbank_match, c("rtime", "target_compound_name", "score")) |>
summarize_match_table("target_compound_name")
pandoc.table(
    st, style = "rmarkdown", split.table = Inf,
    caption = paste0("Experimental MS2 spectra with best match to MS2",
                     " spectra of different compounds. The best match per ",
                     "compound is reported. Rows are ordered by similarity."))
```


#### Summary

- FT0428 (RT=38.11, `[M-H]-` ion): confidence level **A**
- FT0782 (RT=37.7, `[M+HCOO]-`): confidence level **A-**.
- Reference MS2: F15.S0115.


### Uric acid

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Uric acid"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}

             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

We show the EICs for the features above.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

We next look if there are MS2 spectra associated to the above features.

```{r mix01-water-neg-uric-acid-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to pyruvic-acid", echo = FALSE}

```


#### Summary

- FT0397 (RT=176.2, `[M-H]-` ion): confidence level **D** or drop it because of
  low signal?


### Xanthine

```{r, echo = FALSE}
std <- "Xanthine"
```

The table below lists all features that were matched to one of the adducts of 
`r print(std)` that have in addition also on average a twice as high signal in
samples with higher concentrations than in those with lower concentrations.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
tmp <- as.data.frame(mD_WN[mD_WN$target_name == std, ])
tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$rtmed), ]
tmp$feature_group <- group_features(data_WN_FS, rownames(tmp))
pandoc.table(tmp[, c("mzmed", "ppm_error", "rtmed", "target_RT",
                     "feature_group", "target_name", "adduct",
                     "mean_high", "mean_low")], style = "rmarkdown",
             split.tables = Inf, caption = "Feature to standards matches")
```

Based on their retention time, it seems that these features represent signal
from 3 different compounds.

We next plot the EIC for the assigned feature and visually inspect these.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_eics(data_WN, std, tmp, "WN")
```

We next extract the MS2 spectra for all these features and match them against
the reference spectra for `r std` from HMDB.

```{r mix01-water-neg-xanthine-ms2, fig.cap = "MS2 spectra for features matched to xanthine", echo = FALSE}
std_ms2 <- extract_ms2(data_WN, rownames(tmp))

if (length(std_ms2)) {
    par(mar = c(4.2, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5))
    xl <- range(unlist(mz(std_ms2)))
    plotSpectra(std_ms2, xlim = xl)
} else {
    cat("No MS2 spectra found for", std, "\n")
}
```

Unfortunately no MS2 spectra was found.

#### Summary

- FT0315 (RT=140.6, `[M-H]-` ion): confidence level **D** or inherit from
  positive polarity (EIC shape and RT match)?
- FT-633 (RT=140.4, `[M+HCOO]-` ion): confidence level **D** or inherit from
  above.

# Discussion

- Workflow description:
  - Compare all MS2 against MS2 of standards: get an overview for how many we
    would find a MS2.
  - Match features based on m/z
  - Select features with expected difference (confidence **C**).
  - Extract MS2 spectra. If there are some:
    - Calculate similarity against all reference spectra for that
	  standard. Subset to MS2 spectra with ~ considerable
	  similarity. (confidence **B**)
	- Compare similarity of these MS2 against all others in the database
      (FP). If similarity is largest for standard: confidence **A**.
- [ ] Selection of MS2 spectra for reference:
  - add those that match well to the reference spectra.
  - add also all other MS2 spectra with close to the rtmed of the feature
    (require them in addition to have similarity > 0.2?)
- [ ] Since we expect (especially here in water) **only** the standards to be
      present, is there really a need to distinguish between **A** and **B**?
      Isn't that maybe more an indicator how specific a measured MS2 spectrum
      is? i.e. have a specificity score? difference in similarity against
      spectrum to the highest similarity against another compound? Could also
      define that later.
- [ ] TODO: check if we could derive/extract reference spectra for selected
      compounds from MoNA and MassBank: match name and synonyms.
